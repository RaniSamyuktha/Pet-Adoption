# Pet-Adoption
HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge :  Adopt a buddy

# Problem statement

Numerous organizations across the world provide shelter to all homeless animals until they are adopted into a new home. However, finding a loving family for them can be a daunting task at times. This International Homeless Animals Day, Hackerearth present a Machine Learning challenge to us: Adopt a buddy.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of parameters such as a unique ID assigned to each animal that is up for adoption, the date on which they arrived at the shelter, their physical attributes such as color, length, and height, among other factors.
The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:
This challenge will help you to actively enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning
We challenge you to build a predictive model that detects the type and breed of an animal-based on its condition, appearance, and other factors.
